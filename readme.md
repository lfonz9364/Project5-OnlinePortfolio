# Project 5: Online Portfolio

### User Story
Employers and recruiters would like to find an online presence of a potential employee, especially in IT industry.


### Technology Used
* React
* Webpack
* Npm
* Babel

### Approach

I choose to follow the best practice of doing the documentation and planning at the beginning . First of all, I created a wireframe to aid in development designing components and pages. Next, the wireframe then translated into components of React. Then, I developed necessary functions to gave user a selections of view. Last but not least, I added a feature where user could check for yearly educations and experiences to demonstrate my time management development.

### What I Learned

React is a single page application with capability to redraw the same page display rather than just pointing to another page.

React consist of many folder on its development but only require html, css and built bundle.Js files to publish.
